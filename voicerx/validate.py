"""Node 3: safety validation.

Independent of whatever the extraction LLM flagged itself. This layer
exists because the LLM's own self-flagging was proven inconsistent this
session: on the same response, it correctly flagged one garbled term as
uncertain but confidently (and wrongly) resolved a different garbled term
into a named drug. This node does not trust the LLM's confidence - it
re-derives review flags from hard rules.
